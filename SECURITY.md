## Security Announcements

Join the [kubestellar-security-announce](https://groups.google.com/u/1/g/kubestellar-security-announce) group for emails about security and major announcements.

## Report a Vulnerability

We're extremely grateful for security researchers and users that report vulnerabilities to the KubeStellar Open Source Community. All reports are thoroughly investigated by community volunteers.

To report a vulnerability privately, use one of the following channels:

1. **GitHub Security Advisories** — open a private report at:
   https://github.com/kubestellar/homebrew-tap/security/advisories/new

2. **Email** — send details to the private security list:
   [kubestellar-security-announce@googlegroups.com](mailto:kubestellar-security-announce@googlegroups.com)

Please **do not** open a public GitHub issue for suspected security vulnerabilities.

### What to include

- A description of the issue and its potential impact
- Whether the problem is in a formula file, the release/GoReleaser pipeline, a workflow, or repository infrastructure
- Steps to reproduce or validate the issue
- Any proof-of-concept, hashes, raw URLs, or logs that help confirm impact
- Suggested mitigations, if known

### When to report

- You believe a formula in this tap delivers a compromised or malicious binary
- You found a vulnerability in a workflow or the GoReleaser release pipeline that could affect distributed binaries
- You discovered a supply-chain issue that could affect `kc-agent`, `kubestellar-ops`, or `kubestellar-deploy` as distributed via Homebrew

### When NOT to report

- You have a question about how to use one of the tools (use [Slack](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C097094RZ3M) instead)
- The issue is in the upstream source code rather than the distribution pipeline (report upstream in [kubestellar/kubestellar-mcp](https://github.com/kubestellar/kubestellar-mcp/security/advisories/new) or [kubestellar/console](https://github.com/kubestellar/console/security/advisories/new))

## Security Vulnerability Response

Each report is acknowledged and analyzed by the maintainers within 3 working days.

Vulnerability information shared with the security team stays within the KubeStellar project and will not be disclosed publicly until a fix is available and coordinated with the reporter.

## Public Disclosure Timing

A public disclosure date is negotiated between the KubeStellar Security Response Committee and the reporter. We prefer to disclose as soon as a mitigation is available. For straightforward issues, expect 7 days from report to disclosure.
